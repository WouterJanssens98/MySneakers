# Briefing
The briefing of this project was to make a MERN stack application.
We could chose the subject from our own hobbies or things we'd like to add.
My idea was to make a sneaker portfolio app with realtime prices as I have my own business in selling sneakers.

# Resultaat
The application is created for sneaker collectors ("resellers") that want to have a good overview of their stock worth.
Users can search for sneakers and view realtime market prices/ info about the specific shoe they searched for.
After having reviewed their inventory, they can add the desired size to their portfolio.
When going to their portfolio and reviewing it's statistics, the portfolio will update with the user with it's current worth of their inventory. If they decide to sell their pair of limited sneakers, they can always delete it from their portfolio with a simple click.
